At that time, I supported Clint’s business by working as his accountant. I also worked full time as a human resource/benefits manager for another company. I received my insurance license in 2009. In 2011, I started to work full time for Barrett Insurance. 
<br>
<br>I was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. After I graduated from Flint Central High School, I attended Michigan State University where I received a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. Clint and I have a beautiful daughter who also graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Packaging. She is currently the Senior Packaging Engineer for a company in Elk Grove, Illinois. 
<br>
<br>I enjoy kayaking, photography, working in my beautiful yard, and reading. Most of all, I love to travel. My goal is to see all of the national parks.</p>

<br>In 2010, I received the horrible news that I had breast cancer. I AM A SURVIVOR!

<br>I came to Barrett Insurance in 2008 with the belief that insurance is more than just a job. It’s about building long-term relationships and helping people. Bad things happen to good people. Insurance is about making you whole again. Barrett Insurance is not just any agency. My coworkers genuinely care about making a difference. Our work is about “Protecting your dreams”- and I’d like to help.</p>

<br>Hello, I’m Martha. I grew up in Troy, Ohio. I earned my degree in Elementary Education at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. I decided to change careers after a kindergartner accidentally shot me in the foot during ‘Show and Tell!’ I joined the insurance industry in 2003. 
<br>
<br>I take the time to explain the best coverage for your money and make sure you understand your policy before you leave our office. I enjoy the challenge of finding the perfect policy to protect you and your dreams from life's unexpected events. 
<br>
<br>I like gardening, reading, and candy-making during the holiday seasons. I married my husband, Tracy, in 1992. We live in Jonesville with our 3 fur kids. Tracy and I have 2 dogs and a cat. We enjoy working in our yard and in our veggie garden. Specifically, I enjoy working in the yard. I force my husband to do the grunt work. He would rather be in our woods hunting or on the lake fishing. When I go fishing, I take my book and enjoy the sunshine. &nbsp;<br></p>

</strong><br>Licensed Agent Specializing in Commercial Insurance
<br>
<br>I was born in Buffalo New York, where I began my insurance career. I describe myself as a, “commercial insurance geek.” 
<br>
<br>My professional insurance career began in 1970 as a commercial insurance rater after a 4 year enlistment with the Navy. I soon moved into commercial insurance underwriting. The function of an underwriter is to analyze and price business accounts with the objective of making a profit. Once the economics of centralization and downsizing began, I moved to Columbus, Ohio where I worked for Transamerica. I managed a small department before moving to USF&amp;G where I became a Contractor Segment Specialist. I worked with several contractors who built Jacob Field! From Columbus, I moved to Bloomington, Indiana and Great West Casualty – a company that specialized in long haul trucking. I completed my career as an in-house commercial lines specialist with a local agency. 
<br>
<br>Clint invited me to join his staff in July 2014. Although retirement is excellent and I was never bored, I decided to return to work on a limited basis. I wanted to do something tangible with the many years I invested working very hard and learning how the industry works. I decided to use what I learned to help business people with their insurance programs. The years spent with insurance companies provide me with insider knowledge as to how they work and what they do. Before computers, we hand-rated all policies. I know policy rating in detail. My experience allows me to analyze risk and estimate a fair premium. I actually read and study insurance policy forms. I compare what they say to what they should say to offer you the best protection. Regardless of how much your insurance premium is, the value of your investment is found within those 50-200 pages of policy forms and conditions which very few people review. 
<br>
<br>Briefly, I married my wife, Cindy, more than 30 years ago. We raised 5 kids and now, we like spoiling our 5 grandkids. I enjoy the outdoors. I have a constant companion in Holly, my Australian Shepard. I also take great care of three awesome horses.<br></p>

<br>Howdy! My name is Daniel, I've lived in Hillsdale since I was 5 years old. Many of you know me from running 5 Brothers Lawn Care with my brothers when I was in high school and college! I graduated from Liberty University with a Marketing degree, and I decided to work in insurance so I could work with people over a long period of time.
<br><br>I joined Barrett Insurance in August, 2019, I'm training to work primarily with our commercial clients.
<br>
<br>When I'm not raiding the fridge here at Barrett Insurance, I enjoy basketball, fishing, eating donuts, and listening to music. I try to spend as much time in the great outdoors as I can.
<br>
<br>I like talking and solving problems, and I'd love to help protect what is important to you. Stop me at any time to talk about insurance or to share your latest fishing story!<br></p>

<br>Hey, I’m Tiffany. I was born here in Michigan and raised on the Georgia side of Chattanooga, Tennessee. With both of my parents being teachers, I spent many holidays and most summers here in Hillsdale County, where my family has resided since the 1880’s.
<br><br>I earned my Bachelor of Science in Education from Valdosta State University in 2014. As a 5th generation teacher, I love learning, keeping up to date on new developments, and spending time educating people.
<br><br>After managing a doctor’s office and experiencing health insurance from a provider’s perspective, I am now on the preventive side of insurance, working with clients to help them find their best option. My focus is on wellness and maintaining consistent coverage while advocating for preventive care. Get your yearly physical, folks!
<br><br>When I am out of the office, I enjoy searching for interesting finds at thrift stores with my family, weekend road trips, healthy junk food, writing sentences that are too long, and learning to fly.<br></p>

Clint and his sister Lisa were raised on a crop farm and attended Camden Frontier Schools. During high school, Clint served as a leader with the Future Farmers of America (FFA) and participated in showing his animals at the Hillsdale County Fair. Clint later earned a Bachelor’s of Business degree from Michigan State University and a Master of Management degree from Aquinas College.

He was part of the Downtown Development Association (DDA) of Jonesville, the Hillsdale County Community Foundation and the Hillsdale Community Health Center. Clint was also a member of the Hillsdale Exchange club and Jonesville Rotarian. <br>
<br>On August 1, 2015 at the age of 49, Clint Barrett passed away.
