            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Here are a few tips to get you started with the advent of a new school year!
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start school habits now, before school begins. It’s important to keep enjoying
</p><p>summer, but beginning a schedule now may help your child focus on other important
</p><p>things as the school year begins. For example, start your kid/s on a schedule to go to
</p><p>bed early now. It will save you difficulty once the school year begins.
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> After your child goes to bed, check on them to make sure they’re not playing on
</p><p>devices. Even though it may seem relaxing, it’s hard for your child's mind to calm
</p><p>down when they're staring at a phone/tablet screen right before bed.
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> If your child struggles to wake up in the morning, try doing baths/showers the night
</p><p>before. That way, bathing is one less thing to do in the morning.
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Depending on the age of your kid/s, give instructions one at a time. Instead of
</p><p>saying, “Do this, and this, and this, and that,” say, “Do this.” Then, follow up to make
</p><p>sure your child followed that instruction. Then repeat. This will save you and your
</p><p>child a lot of potential stress.
</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Talk to your child about their day, everyday. Learning to communicate in a
</p><p>free-flowing way while your kid/s are young will help you communicate more
</p><p>openly as your child becomes an adult.

</p><p>or theft, not covered by your insurance policy. If you have a student heading
</p><p>away to school, below are a few tips to help you get the most out of your
</p><p>coverage.
</p><p><strong>HOMEOWNERS
</strong></p><p>● Personal Property: Most homeowners policies will cover personal
</p><p>property for up to 10% of your total policy while your child is residing at
</p><p>school (a $100,000 policy equals $10,000 in coverage). Not all types of
</p><p>damage are covered, so read your policy carefully. Some items such as
</p><p>jewelry or expensive electronics, require special coverage. Renters
</p><p>insurance is strongly recommended.
</p><p>● Liability Coverage: General damage to a dorm room or apartment is not
</p><p>usually covered.
</p><p>● Documentation: Creating an inventory of the items your child is taking
</p><p>to school is a good idea. Use photographs and keep receipts.
</p><p><strong>AUTO
</strong></p><p>● Car Stays Home: Keep your child listed on your auto policy if they will
</p><p>still drive your car while at home on school breaks.
</p><p>● Car at School: Make sure to notify us if your child will be taking a car
</p><p>away to school. In most cases, if the car is registered to you and listed
</p><p>on your policy, it will be covered.
</p><p>● Driving a Friend’s Car: Students are generally covered if they are listed
</p><p>on their parent’s policy and are not regularly using the vehicle. The
</p><p>coverage would be secondary. The insurance for the friend’s vehicle
</p><p>would be the primary coverage.
</p><p>● Discounts: A full-time student meeting certain academic requirements
</p><p>can qualify for a good student discount. Distant student discounts may
</p><p>also be available. Drivers under 21 who have completed driver’s
</p><p>education may also get a discount.
</p><p><strong>Before your child leaves for school, call us at (517) 849-1000 or email
</strong></p><p><strong>insure@barrettins.com.
</strong></p><p><strong>We can walk you through the steps to ensure you have the right coverage.

</p><p>Stop by our office to pick up your own copy.
</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>So how do you survive
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">this transition? Learn&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">to embrace it.&nbsp;</span></strong><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you prepare to see your adolescent off to college, you flash back to all your
</p><p>child’s milestones, special moments, and fun times you’ve shared together.
</p><p>it feels like only yesterday your toddler said their first word. Soon after, you
</p><p>dropped your child off for their first day of kindergarten, prepared your preteen
</p><p>for puberty, and took your teen shopping for the high school prom.
</p><p>But now, in what feels like an instant, your young adult is headed out into the
</p><p>world, more or less on their own. This is a turning point at which you no longer
</p><p>have much oversight or say in your child’s life. This can be both scary and
</p><p>exhilarating for parents and kids alike. You’ll worry about your adolescent’s
</p><p>safety and well-being. But you’ll also revel in your child’s enthusiasm,
</p><p>excitement, and dreams for the future.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents’ feelings about their own life without their child’s daily presence and
</p><p>parenting responsibilities are often met with a mix of emotions as well. Many
</p><p>parents look forward to this point in their lives and a freedom they haven’t
</p><p>enjoyed in nearly two decades. Some parents may even feel conflicted or guilty
</p><p>for looking forward to ‘me’ time.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, many parents (even those same parents) feel a sense of loss.
</p><p>After all, they’ve devoted 18 years to caregiving and raising their child. Many
</p><p>parents lose their sense of self while raising a family. In fact, being a parent can
</p><p>become one’s identity. As a result, parents may feel an even greater loss when
</p><p>their kid heads away to college.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A heart-to-heart.</strong> Write a letter or talk to your adolescent when you see him or
</p><p>her off to college. A letter is best because your kid can save it and read it again
</p><p>to absorb and ponder what you have to say. You’ve already taught your child
</p><p>the importance of manners and doing their schoolwork. So skip that stuff.
</p><p>Instead, offer wisdom about life and your appreciation for your adolescent’s
</p><p>wonderful characteristics. Also, avoid dumping on your child. It’s okay to say
</p><p>you’re going to miss your kid. But don’t overdo it and leave your child feeling
</p><p>guilty or responsible for your pain or loss.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Connection and space.</strong> Decide how to keep the connection with your
</p><p>adolescent. Phone calls, texting, email, video chat, and getting together in
</p><p>person offer ample opportunities to maintain your relationship. But don’t overdo
</p><p>it. Your young adult needs time and space to experience their newfound
</p><p>independence and blossom.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Explore.</strong> You now have a lot more free time. Don’t let that downtime become an
</p><p>avenue to needlessly worry or mope. Instead, be proactive, and set out on a
</p><p>mission of self-discovery. Have you thought about going back to school, work,
</p><p>or changing your career? Now’s a good time to explore your options. How about
</p><p>a new hobby, volunteer work, or focusing on your fitness and health? You can
</p><p>also broaden your horizons. Try out different music genres, visit art and history
</p><p>museums, go to plays and sporting events, or explore cultural restaurants or
</p><p>cooking.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Travel.</strong> Plan something exciting. Consider a trip to someplace you’ve always
</p><p>dreamed of going. Or perhaps plan a long road trip or multiple weekend road
</p><p>trips throughout the year. Whatever you choose will help busy your time with the
</p><p>planning, give you something to look forward to, and remind you of the upside of
</p><p>an empty nest or one less child to raise.
</p><p>It gets easier. Remember, whatever grief, loneliness, worries, or self-doubts you
</p><p>experience, they’re a normal part of this transition. With each week and month
</p><p>that passes, it’ll get easier – until one day, you wake up and discover you’ve
</p><p>fully embraced your new life – and feel true joy for your child’s newfound
</p><p>independence.</p><p></p></div>
